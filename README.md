# Raven Checkers
## Project description
Raven is a checkers game program, for one or two players. While there are examples of excellent & free checkers programs out on the net (such as [Martin Fierz's Checkerboard](http://www.fierz.ch/checkers.htm)), Raven has a few differences.

* **Open-source code**. Raven uses existing open source code as a basis ([Martin Fierz's Simple Checkers evaluation function](http://www.fierz.ch/engines.php) and [Peter Norvig's search code from the AIMA project](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/python/readme.html)) for its AI engine.
* **Cross-platform**. Raven is written using Python 2.7 using its standard libraries. It has been tested on Windows, OS X Yosemite, and Linux Mint (Cassandra).
* **Great for checkers study**. Raven allows you to quickly set up board configurations using standard checkerboard notation. You can also describe your moves in the annotation window, and you can save and load games for later study. This is great for working through checkers books and learning techniques and tactics.
