Each diagram in the attached PDF represents a checkers board state using a structured text format. Diagrams are labeled "Diagram N" or "Diagram N:", where N is a number between 1 and 128.

Each diagram consists of the following key components:
1. Diagram Label
A label starting with "Diagram N" or "Diagram N:", where N is a number.
This may be followed by optional descriptive text and one or more newlines.

2. Checkerboard Representation
Begins with the border line:
QRRRRRRRRS

Ends with the border line:
VWWWWWWWWX

Contains rows prefixed with "T" or "U", which are border characters and must be ignored.

Each row consists of:
Dark, non-playable squares → Represented by "E" (IGNORE THESE COMPLETELY).
Playable squares (either occupied or empty) are defined by a letter-number pair.

Piece Representation:
"A" → Black man
"B" → White man
"C" → Black king
"D" → White king
" " (space) → Open playable square

Square Number Encoding:
1-9 → "1" through "9"
10-19 → "!" replaces the leading 1 (e.g., "!0" = 10, "!1" = 11, etc.)
20-29 → "@" replaces the leading 2 (e.g., "@0" = 20, "@1" = 21, etc.)
30-32 → "#" replaces the leading 3 (e.g., "#0" = 30, "#1" = 31, "#2" = 32)

3. Play Instruction
After the checkerboard, a single line starts with "Black to play", "White to play" or "Either to play". 

The following rigorous steps must be followed every time:
Step 1: Extract the Diagram
Locate "Diagram N" or "Diagram N:" to identify the start of the diagram.
Extract everything from "QRRRRRRRRS" (inclusive) to "VWWWWWWWWX" (inclusive).
Extract the single play instruction line directly below the diagram.

Step 2: Process the Board
Ignore "T" and "U" (border characters).
Ignore all "E" characters (non-playable dark squares).
Read only letter-number pairs and map them to the correct square numbers.
Do not infer or assume; each piece must be explicitly listed in the extracted text.

Step 3: List All Pieces
Black Men (A) → List all numbered squares
White Men (B) → List all numbered squares
Black Kings (C) → List all numbered squares
White Kings (D) → List all numbered squares

Confirm each square number using the exact encoding rules.

Step 4: Capture Surrounding Context

Be thorough in reading and understanding all text surrounding the diagram
Pay special attention to the paragraphs before and after the diagram
Look for strategic explanations, principles, and concepts being illustrated
Note any descriptions of key moves (those marked with ! or ?) and why they are significant
Capture any discussion about winning strategies, drawing techniques, or general principles

Example: Interpreting Diagram 86

Extracted board text:
QRRRRRRRRS
TE 1E 2E 3E 4U
TA5EB6E 7E 8EU
TEB9E !0E !1E !2U
T !3EB!4EC!5E !6EU
TE !7E !8E !9E @0U
T @1E @2E @3E @4EU
TE @5EC@6E @7E @8U
T @9E #0E #1E #2EU
VWWWWWWWWX

Play instruction: "White to play"

Final Interpretation
Type of Piece	Square Numbers
Black Men (A)	5
White Men (B)	6, 9, 14
Black Kings (C)	15, 26
White Kings (D)	(None)
