# FEN Description for American Checkers (8x8 Board)

The Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) represents a checkers position in a concise string format. For American Checkers, the FEN format follows this pattern:

[TURN]:[COLOR1][PIECES]:[COLOR2][PIECES]

Where:
- [TURN] is either "W" (White's turn) or "B" (Black's turn)
- [COLOR1] is always "W" for White pieces
- [COLOR2] is always "B" for Black pieces
- [PIECES] is a comma-separated list of piece positions, with kings prefixed by "K"

## Format Rules:
1. The FEN always begins with the turn indicator "W" or "B" followed by a colon
2. White pieces are always listed first, then Black pieces
3. Regular men are indicated by just their square number
4. Kings are indicated by "K" followed immediately by their square number
5. Multiple pieces of the same color are separated by commas
6. The two color sections are separated by a colon
7. No spaces are allowed in the FEN string
8. Square numbers range from 1-32

## Examples:

Starting position (White to move):
W:W21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32:B1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12

White has two kings, Black has one king and one man (Black to move):
B:WK10,K20:B5,K15

White has one king, Black has three kings (White to move):
W:WK23:BK7,K10,K15

Two kings vs one king (Either to play):
W:WK5,K10:BK20
B:WK5,K10:BK20

## Important Notes:
1. When generating a FEN string from a diagram, first determine the turn from the accompanying instruction line ("Black to play", "White to play", or "Either to play").
2. When the instruction says "Either to play", use the side specified first in the continuation text.
3. In PDN files, the FEN tag must be formatted as: [FEN "W:W1,2:B3,4"] (including the quotes)
4. Men and kings should be listed in ascending order by square number for readability (though this is not required by the standard)
