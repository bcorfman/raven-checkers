**Cross opening**, part of the 11-15 group.

11-15 is considered Black's best opening move. It is so popular that it has
branched off into more openings than any other initial move. Among the replies
that can be recommended for White are 23-19 or 23-18 or 22-18 or 22-17. On the
other hand, 24-20 and 24-19 and 21-17 are all considered inferior in varying
degrees.
