**White to move and win.**

With 3 Kings v 2 Kings, there are three cases to be considered:

# Where the defending kings occupy opposite double-corners;
# Where the defending kings occupy the same double-corner;
# Where the defending kings occupy the same single-corner.


The third case is illustrated in this scenario. White must employ a sacrifice
before he can win.
