**White to move and win.**

With 3 Kings v 2 Kings, there are three cases to be considered:

# Where the defending kings occupy opposite double-corners;
# Where the defending kings occupy the same double-corner;
# Where the defending kings occupy the same single-corner.


The first case is illustrated in this scenario.

When the two Black kings occupy opposite double-corners, the win is effected by
forcing an exchange. Black, of course, tries to avoid this.
