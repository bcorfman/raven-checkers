**Key Ending 10: First Position**
//Summary// Force: 2 v 2. Opposition: White has it. Terms: White to move and
win. Description: The diagrammed position represents a late, and critical, phase
of First Position. Before tackling the winning procedure, it would be wise for
the student to take note of those features which distinguish First Position from
a nondescript two against two setting. In this way he will be able to recognize
it in its early stages, and take the appropriate action. Aside from the
attacker, having the Opposition, here White, the following conditions must also
hold:

# At least one of the defender's pieces is a single man rather than a king.
# A single man pinned to the right-hand side of the board. Typically, this man will initially be placed on square 3, 4 or 12. Of course, if it was placed on square 1 or 2, then it would have free access to White's left-hand side, and the position would just be a draw.
# The defender's other piece, which becomes a king (in the double-corner), is unable to reach the sanctuary of the opposite double-corner.


Broadly speaking, White's winning procedure consists of attacking Black's king,
immobilizing it, and forcing Black's single man to advance into trouble.
Naturally, Black tries to avoid the advance of this man for as long as possible.
This theme, of attacking one piece to force another to move, arises in numerous
endings, and should be thoroughly grasped by the student.
