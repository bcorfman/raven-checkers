**Payne's Single-Corner Win for White**

//Diagnosis//

Force: 2 v 2. Terms: Either to move; White wins. Description: Even more
fundamental to the  concept of single-corner confinement is the following ending
by William Payne, which may properly be considered a phase of the American
Position. The crucial piece here is the White king on 26, which stands guard
until the other White piece (which could in fact be virtually anywhere on the
board) is ready to attack.
